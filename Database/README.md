# Database Management Systems
Software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.
There are two types of DBMSs: relational(SQL) and non-relational(NoSQL)

## realational database

Consisting two or more tables with columns and rows. 

**Each column** represent property of that item.

**Each row** represent item.

Realation between table and field are called a **schema**.

**Primary keys** serve as unique identifiers for each column in a database table. 

**Foreign keys** link data in one table to the data in another table

Using SQL query to communicate with server

**Schema must be clearly defiend**.
